# multi-stack-montage
An ImageJ1 plugin for making montages out of stacks


This is the Eclipse project for this plugin. If you just want to use it, I recommend you install Fiji and tick our update site (PTBIOP).

to install it on ImageJ, just dowload the jar file from the bin folder.

See the Fiji Wiki for more information and demos.
